ppgplot - The Pythonic interface to PGPLOT

ppgplot is a python module (extension) providing bindings to the 
PGPLOT graphics library. PGPLOT is a scientific visualization 
(graphics) library written in Fortran by T. J. Pearson. C bindings
for PGPLOT are also available. ppgplot makes the library usable by 
Python programs. It uses the numeric / numarray modules (nowadays 
replaced by Numpy), to efficiently represent and manipulate vectors
and matrices.
